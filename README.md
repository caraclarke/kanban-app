# Kanban App #

Kanban allows you to track the status of tasks. A Kanban project uses columns (or lanes) and notes. Notes move through columns that represent stages of the project. They move as they change work status from reviewing, to implementing, to completed. Notes include information about the task, what it relates to and potentially priority and due date.

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a great online example of Kanban.

Tracking tasks as individuals and as a whole is crucial when planning a project. This Kanban app can be used to track tasks that someone would want to complete by a specific dealdine, whether they use it to plan their day or their week.
